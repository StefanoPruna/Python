Hello

this is a simple report test

python
with open("report.txt") as file_in:
...     for line in file_in: 
...             word = line.strip()
...             print(word)

then enter and it will print the content of the report.txt file

file_out.write(line )
it will rewrite all the content
another way is:
file_out = open("report.txt", "w")
line4 = "ciao a tutti"
and it will replace the content and place it in the line4
